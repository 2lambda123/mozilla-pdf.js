## "Hello World" overview

This example is a minimalistic application of the pdf.js project. The file 
`helloworld.pdf` is from the GNUpdf project (see [Introduction to PDF at
GNUpdf] (http://gnupdf.org/Introduction_to_PDF)), and contains a simple and
human-readable PDF.


## Getting started

Rather than simply pulling `index.html` into the browser, you'll have to serve the pages through a web server.  You can do this on your machine locally without the need for a net connection.  Run the server from the root directory of the project, and then in your browser, browse to the `index.html` file inside the `examples/helloworld/` folder, or just point to the folder itself.  

For example, with the server running on, say, port 8000, you would use this url :

`http://localhost:8000/examples/helloworld/`

Voila!

Take a peek at `hello.js` to see how to make basic calls to `pdf.js`.
